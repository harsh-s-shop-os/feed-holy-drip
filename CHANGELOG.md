# Changelog

Human-readable log of what changed in the onboarding prototype, for product review. Updated at each local commit — most recent first.

## 2026-09-20 — Rebuilt on the latest feed-cosmix code (266e3bd), HolyDrip content re-applied

The first HolyDrip commit was made on a copy of feed-cosmix that was 45 commits behind. This one takes feed-cosmix's current `index.html` as the base and re-applies every HolyDrip change on top, so the fork now carries everything the Cosmix build has learned since 18 September:

- **Left rail, collapsed and expanded.** Collapsed it shows Home, Search and Agents only; the other items, the foot (notifications, theme, credits, workspace badge) and their labels fold away. Hovering an icon shows its name; hovering Agents opens the agents fly-out, titled "Agents" while the rail is collapsed. Clicking the logo opens the rail to 236px and the page moves over to make room (no dim, no drawer) on desktop; on a phone it stays a drawer with a scrim. Hover no longer opens the rail.
- **Top bar.** The deck toggle (or the Pro invitation) now sits at the top right on the Feed tab; on the Chat tab the credits take that spot and the toggle moves into the rail foot. The Feed | Chat pill is centred and its padding widened.
- **Intro card.** The feed opens with a three-slide intro card (This is your feed / Jam with agents or humans / Approve and publish), shown once per load, dots in the header row. Its three illustrations were re-graded from Cosmix green to the HolyDrip steel blue and bone, and the wash under the headline is near-black blue.
- **Feed.** Unrevealed cards rest at 20% so the next one peeks; the setup-complete toast is gone (the intro card covers it); the setup columns fold their intro line into a status line once the first card lands; more air between tabs, stories and feed.
- **GEO object.** The visibility cards in feed-cosmix now template from one `GEO` object. HolyDrip's copy of it holds placeholder numbers for a pre-launch, social-first brand (score 12, cited on 0 of 8 discovery prompts, Myntra / Amazon / Ajio / Tata CLiQ / Reddit as the cited sources). Nothing reads from it yet in this fork; it is there so the next visibility card can.

Content changes made to feed-cosmix in that range (the Launch Reveal creative, the Cosmix GEO report cards, the Editorial Pour text card) are Cosmix-only and were not carried over. All HolyDrip cards, stories, signals, brand memory and assets from the previous entry are unchanged.

For future ports: feed-cosmix is registered as the local git remote `cosmix-local` in this repo, so `git fetch cosmix-local` and a cherry-pick or diff is one step.

## 2026-09-20 — HolyDrip: the whole prototype rebranded from Cosmix

This fork now reads as HolyDrip, the premium menswear marketplace (holydrip.club, @holydrip.club). Nothing structural changed; every piece of brand content did.

- **Workspace and brand memory.** Default store is holydrip.club, workspace badge and deck sidebar carry the HOLY DR/P mark, the finish screen says "HolyDrip, welcome to your feed". The Brand column now reads HolyDrip: marketplace positioning, Subtle's Cloud Tee as the first drop, member pricing, Tiruppur, the Uniqlo/Zara/M&S/H&M comparison, audience, and Myntra / Ajio / Tata CLiQ / The Collective as industry leaders. Brand kit is black, maroon and steel blue with Bodoni Moda headings and Geist body, read off the live site and the Instagram grid.
- **Feed: 18 cards, three per column, no more.** Catalog (shot standard at intake, attribute coverage by category, the macro pair), Creatives (the poster format, the Tiruppur mill story, cross-brand styling), Ads (seller-funded placements, followers are not a buyer list, reels as the creative test), Storefront (no Shopify: headless CMS, the size guide is a picture, the comparison table as a module), Visibility (unclaimed category answer, social-rich search-invisible, spec facts not marked up). The deck-only extras are gone; the free feed and the Pro columns show the same 15 posts plus the three Signals.
- **Signals.** The three journeys are now about member-price unlocks: unlocked-but-never-bought (WhatsApp), first-drop buyers get the next drop early (email), and lapsed unlocks asked a question (WhatsApp). Sources: the Shopify source is now "HolyDrip store"; Klaviyo, WhatsApp and support stay.
- **Connect cards.** The Shopify connect card is now "Connect the CMS", with a plug icon instead of the Shopify mark, because HolyDrip runs a custom stack.
- **Stories.** Rings and slides repainted from the HolyDrip palette. "Popular ads" is now "Top reels" and shows three real Instagram covers.
- **Assets.** Every `cx-*` file, the Cosmix mark and the unused Shopify logo are deleted. 40 new `hd-*` files pulled from holydrip.club, its CDN, the drop-page video and the Instagram grid: the four LP poster frames, the PDP gallery (on-model, ghost mannequin, collar macro, skin-tone guide, size lineup, colour rail), the eight colourway cutouts, texture and craftsman shots, the size chart, lab QR, brand story, both wordmarks, and seven reel covers. Only 25 are referenced today; the rest sit in `assets/` ready to slot in.

**Known limits.** Every number on a card is a placeholder. The Instagram covers are grid size (360px) and look soft on a large card, so they only appear in stories and small slots. Celebrity reel covers (Diljit, Raghav Juyal, Jacob Batalon, Vir Das) were deliberately left out. The team's catalog images have not arrived yet, so the catalog cards lean on Subtle's one listing.

## 2026-09-18 — Data cards: the table never touches the CTA

The key-value table on data cards (e.g. "Five products are disapproved on Meta") sat flush against the CTA bar below it. It now keeps the same air on every side — 12px side insets, 14px above and 14px below — as a written rule in the stylesheet, so it holds wherever the table appears (feed, deck, setup columns) and whatever follows it.

## 2026-09-18 — Mobile setup: polish pass

Phone only; nothing changes on a laptop.

- **One divider, not two** under the column tab row — the leftover per-column rule under the old titles is gone.
- **Bigger tab labels**, sized to be tapped comfortably; the row scrolls sideways if the tabs don't all fit.
- **The expand chevron has no button background** — just the icon, rotating on expand/collapse.
- **The commentary now fades out smoothly** as it nears the agent row, instead of being cut off by a hard edge.
- **Collapsed by default shows only the agent row and the chevron** — the store URL and the running commentary are hidden until you expand.
- **"Connect Meta Ads" / "Connect Shopify" cards drop the "needs access" line** — just the agent name now.
- **The workspace badge (bottom of the rail) shows the Cosmix mark**, not a plain "C".
- **The "I don't have a Brand" row uses a question-mark icon**, not a plus.

## 2026-09-18 — Mobile setup: two accordions, columns as tabs

Phone only; nothing changes on a laptop.

- **The setup rail is a quarter of the screen**, not 40%. The store URL row stays pinned at the top; the commentary underneath scrolls itself to whatever line is being written, so the newest thing is always in view. The agents no longer show names — they sit as a row of small avatars pinned at the bottom of the rail (tap one and its name pops up for a moment).
- **A chevron at the bottom right of the rail expands it** to the full screen, folding the columns down to just their tab row. Tap the chevron again, or anywhere on the tab row, and the rail folds back to its quarter and the columns return. Two accordions: opening one closes the other; the rail never closes below its quarter.
- **The columns are tabs.** Instead of each column carrying its own large title, a single row above the columns names all of them — Brand, Creatives, Ads, Storefront, Visibility — with the one on screen highlighted. Tap a tab to jump to that column; swiping the columns moves the highlight. Columns still waiting on the brand show dimmed in the row. The same tab row runs above the Pro deck on a phone (Signals, Catalog, Creatives…), where the deck sidebar is not available.
- Carried in an uncommitted local fix: the Feed | Chat pill stays attached to its tab on phones (`.seg` position:relative).

## 2026-09-18 — Mobile: the whole flow now works on a phone (branch `mobile`, first draft)

Below 700px wide the prototype re-lays itself out for a phone. Nothing changes on a laptop; this is the same file, responding to the screen it is on.

- **First screen**: the headline wraps instead of running off the edge, the URL field and "Build My Team" fill the width, and the "I don't have a Brand" wizard stacks the same way.
- **Setup**: the setup rail (store URL, the running commentary, the agents waking up) sits *above* the columns instead of beside them, capped at about 40% of the screen and scrollable. Each column below fills the screen; swipe sideways to move between Brand Memory, Creatives, Ads and the rest. The columns still reveal themselves left to right as they fill.
- **Navigation**: the left rail is gone from the page and becomes a drawer. A menu button at the top left opens it (same contents: Home, Search, Library, Agents, Skills, Memory, History, workspace badge); tap the dark area to close. The top bar keeps Feed | Chat, the layout switch (or the Pro invitation) and credits; the theme and notifications chips are hidden on phones for now.
- **Feed**: one column, edge to edge with a 12px gutter. Tune Feed and Jam with Team sit centred along the bottom instead of stacked over the cards.
- **Pro deck**: one agent column per screen, snapping as you swipe. Column edges can't be dragged on a phone (there is nothing to resize).
- **Overlays**: Upgrade to Pro, Jam with team, Tune, Upload and Out-of-credits open as bottom sheets; the CRM drawer, History and the Agents page go full width; the creative editor keeps the image, thumbnails, toolbar (scrolls sideways) and the edit box, and drops the zoom control and the View input / Add annotations buttons for now.
- Hover tooltips (column-switch labels, card action tips) are switched off on touch screens, where a tap would otherwise leave them stuck open.

**Known gaps in this draft**: the theme toggle and notifications have no home on the phone top bar yet; the deck sidebar (Cosmix summary, column filters, dashboard card) is not reachable on a phone; the setup rail does not auto-scroll to its latest line; nothing has been checked on a real device, only in a phone-sized browser.

## 2026-09-18 — Creative director outputs open in an edit view, not in chat

Clicking "Remix with Agent" on any Creative director card (feed, deck or the loading columns) now opens that creative full-screen in its own editor overlay, in place of the chat flow that Remix normally opens. Clicking the image itself does nothing, as before. Jam with Team, and Remix on every other agent, are unchanged and still go to chat. The overlay: campaign name and zoom control (−/+, 25% steps, 25–200%) top left; View input, Add annotations, version history, download and close top right; the creative in the middle at 75%, with a thumbnail strip under it; the Split Layers / Upscale / Remove BG / Resize Image / More Actions toolbar and the "Describe your edits" box at the bottom. A card with several images shows all of them as thumbnails with previous/next arrows beside the image (keyboard ← → also work); it opens on whichever slide the card was showing. Esc or × closes.

- Each Creative director post now carries a campaign name for the editor title: Ingredient Story, Morning Ritual, Editorial Pour, The Transformation, Launch Reveal (shown as "Campaign: Cosmix").
- The toolbar and header actions show a confirmation toast in this prototype; nothing is generated yet.

## 2026-09-18 — Finish screen copy

The onboarding finish screen now reads "Cosmix, welcome to your feed". The button under it is unchanged (still "Get started").

## 2026-09-18 — Stories in Cosmix colours, slowly moving

- The four story rings above the feed are repainted from the Cosmix palette (green, terracotta, cream), as soft blurred washes rather than hard gradients; the googly eyes are gone.
- Opening a story: each of its three slides takes one of the three colours from its ring (same order), as a blurred, slowly drifting wash behind the text. The movement runs continuously on the ring and inside the story; it stops for anyone with reduced motion turned on.
- Text over the cream slide sits on a slightly stronger dark scrim so the title and close button stay readable.

## 2026-09-18 — Cosmix build: the current prototype, filled with Cosmix

This fork now runs on the same code as the main (Urban Performance) prototype, with every piece of brand content swapped for Cosmix. Nothing in the flow, the layout or the interactions differs from main; only what the cards, stories and setup say.

**What is the same as main (new to this fork)**
- The first screen's three paths: enter a URL, "See ShopOS in action" (7 demo brands), "I don't have a Brand" (3-question wizard).
- The loading state's Brand Memory column (editable cards, discard on edit, the Shopify connect row) and the one-line status under each column title.
- The single feed and the Pro deck show the same set of cards, interleaved automatically, with the Meta and Shopify connect prompts anchored to specific cards.
- Card menu and dock copy: "Copy link to share", "Tune Feed", "Jam with Team". Finish screen reads "Your brand's feed is ready".

**What is Cosmix**
- Build My Team with an empty field opens cosmix.in; the setup rail shows cosmix.in and reads the real catalog size (80 products).
- Brand Memory is written from cosmix.in: About the brand, Brand guidelines (the real wordmark, the theme's green / terracotta / cream, Recoleta headings with Manrope body), Voice and tone, Company (founded 2019 by Vibha Harish and Soorya Jagdish, Bengaluru, in-house manufacturing, Marico's 60% stake at a ₹375 cr valuation), Product catalog, Product information, Audience, Industry leaders (The Whole Truth, OZiva, Kapiva, Wellbeing Nutrition). Any other host still gets the generic placeholder set.
- All 22 feed and deck cards, the four stories, History, the CRM drawer copy and the column status streams carry the Cosmix copy and imagery from the previous Cosmix build, unchanged.
- The Cosmix spiral mark sits in the deck sidebar; the workspace badge reads C / Cosmix.

**Media rules kept from the previous Cosmix build**
- Every post image renders as a square, cropped from the top, including landscape art. A card can ask for its image to be fitted rather than filled (the nutrition-panel card), and a chart card can carry supporting images as a carousel (the discovery-prompts card).

**Housekeeping**
- Cosmix pack shots that still sat under Point Taken filenames (ptup-*, pt-*) are renamed cx-*; the unused Urban Performance photography is not carried over.
- Known gap: the feed cards say "5 of 40" products (copy from the earlier Cosmix build) while the store, and the setup rail, count 80.

## 2026-09-18 — Ring card: drop the "Health" tag, center the score

The number in the middle of the Apple-Health-style ring card had a small "Health" label above it. Removed it and let the score sit centered in the rings on its own.


## 2026-09-18 — Drop the dial-variant brand-health card; fix the connect-card anchors it broke

The dial read of the brand-health card is commented out of `POSTS` (three passes at the shape, none of them right — kept, not deleted, in case it's worth another attempt). That shifted every index after it, which broke the meta/Shopify connect-card placement in the feed: it was anchored to `POSTS[1]`/`POSTS[3]` by position, and `POSTS[3]` no longer pointed at the card it was supposed to. Anchored by title instead, so it can't silently point at the wrong card again — and while fixing it, moved the Shopify prompt to follow the Cloud Soft Tee storefront post instead of the old dial card, which fits the "publish the changes" copy better anyway.


## 2026-09-18 — Feed and Pro deck now show the same cards

The single-column feed was quietly a subset of what Pro mode's columns show: it was missing one image post, one data-led post, and all eight cards that used to be deck-only, twelve cards short of the full twenty-two. The feed's card order now comes from the same three lists the deck reads (interleaved for rhythm rather than dumped in as one long block), so any card added to those lists appears in both places automatically. Signals stays deck-only, as intended — everything else is now identical either way you look at the feed.


## 2026-09-18 — Feed card copy: clearer labels

- Card menu: "Copy link" is now "Copy link to share"
- Bottom-right dock: "Tune" is now "Tune Feed", "Jam" is now "Jam with Team"


## 2026-09-18 — Onboarding: "Your brand's feed is ready"

The finish-screen headline is now "Your brand's feed is ready" (was "Your feed is ready").


## 2026-09-18 — Brand Memory: discard on edits, no scrolling, fewer and clearer cards

**Discard, not just save**
Editing a card now shows a check and a cross, not just a check. Check keeps what you typed; the cross puts the card back exactly as it was — text and any tags you removed while editing.

**Toned down the edit chrome**
No background box behind the text you're editing, and no background on the check/cross buttons — just the icons, so editing doesn't call more attention to itself than the card's content does.

**Tag crosses only take up space while the card is being edited**
A tag pill used to reserve room for its remove-cross at all times (revealed on hover). Now the cross has zero width until the card enters editing state, then the pill opens up to show it. No dead space on cards you're not touching.

**Dropped the fixed-height, scrolling cards**
Cards were pinned to one height with an internal scrollbar; nothing in them was ever long enough to need it. Cards now size to their own content — short cards are short, longer ones are taller.

**Fewer cards, clearer purpose**
Cut Pricing, Channels, Drops and collections, standalone Business landscape, Growth direction, and the "Still missing" card. Merged the two Product information cards into one. Company now carries a bit more of what Business landscape used to say, since that's where it belongs. Catalog is now "Product catalog" and says plainly what's being pulled together. Audience keeps its text, loses its (repetitive) tags. Competitors keeps its tags, loses its description — just the names. Voice and tone moved up next to the new "Brand guidelines" card (the old untitled Brand Kit card now has a name). Nine cards total, down from fifteen.

**New: a Shopify connect row**
Reuses the exact connector-row shape from the Signals column — logo, name, one line, a white Connect button — with copy written for this moment ("Connect Shopify for detailed product analytics."). It's the one card in the column that isn't a finding, so it carries no edit icon; clicking Connect gives it its own short, self-contained "Connecting → Connected" state.


## 2026-09-18 — Brand Memory: editable, scrollable cards during loading

**The first column of the loading state ("Brand Memory") is now editable**
Each card is a fixed height and scrolls inside itself if the copy runs long, so editing one card never pushes the others down the column. A pencil icon in the top-right corner opens editing — click it and the card's description becomes an input; click the checkmark (or press Enter) to save, or press Escape to cancel. A soft fade at the bottom of a card is the cue that there's more to scroll to.

**New: generic, reusable card titles**
Card titles are no longer one-off headlines specific to a single demo brand (e.g. "The Flex henley is leading the brand right now"). They're now a fixed set of category labels — "About the brand," "Product information," "Business landscape," "Growth direction" — that make sense for any brand ShopOS reads. The label stays put; only the finding underneath it (what was actually read off the store) is what gets edited.

**Only text cards are editable**
The Brand Kit card (logo, colors, typeface swatches) carries no edit icon — it isn't a text finding, so there's nothing to type into.

**Confirmed: this column only ever appears during loading**
It's built fresh each time onboarding runs and is never carried into the finished feed — nothing else needed to change here, but flagging it since it came up as a question this session.

## 2026-09-17 — Onboarding flow: two new paths, a product-first wizard, and polish

**New: two more ways to start, right on the first screen**
Below the "Enter your store URL" field, there are now two extra options: **"See ShopOS in action"** and **"I don't have a Brand"**. Typing a real URL into the field automatically hides these two options (typing anything else does not); the field also silently blocks characters that can't appear in a URL as you type.

**New: "See ShopOS in action" → pick a demo brand**
Clicking it opens a brand-picker screen with 7 sample brands (Dunder Mifflin, Los Pollos Hermanos, Chocolate Frogs, Fishwife, Miu Miu, Vacation Inc., Dorsey). Picking one and continuing runs the same setup/loading experience as a real store. Only the parts of the screen that actually change (the subtitle, the body, the button label) animate — the logo and headline never move.

**New: "I don't have a Brand" → a 3-question wizard**
Instead of jumping straight to setup with no information, this now asks three quick questions, one at a time: what's your product, who's your audience, what should we call your Brand. Answering one reveals the next; each answered question collapses to show just the answer with a pencil icon to go back and edit it. Editing an earlier answer discards whichever questions came after it, so the flow always makes sense. The brand name you type here now also shows up in the "URL" field on the loading screen, instead of a generic placeholder.

**Fixes and polish**
- The "Build My Team" button on the first screen always shows in its active white state — it no longer greys out when the input is empty.
- Clicking anywhere inside a text field (not just precisely on the text) now focuses it.
- The "Try your own Brand" button on the brand-picker screen is no longer stretched to match the width of the button next to it — it sizes to its own label.
- Fixed a background color mismatch (was pure black, should be the site's standard near-black) on both the URL screen and the brand-picker screen.
- Fixed a couple of small spacing/alignment misses in the new 3-question wizard so its icons and text line up with the rest of the screen.
- Set up version control for this prototype so changes can be tracked going forward.
